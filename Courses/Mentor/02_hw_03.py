"""

Following dictionary {'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop', '5h': 'bqueen', '3e': 'wking'}
represents a chess board. Write a function named isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary argument
and returns True or False depending on if the board is valid.

A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each player can only have
at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid space from '1a' to '8h'; that is,
a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w' or 'b' to represent white or black,
followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or 'king'. This function should detect when a bug
has resulted in an improper chess board.
